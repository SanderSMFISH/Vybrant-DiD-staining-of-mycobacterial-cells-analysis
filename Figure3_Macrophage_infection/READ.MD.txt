Analysis Cell Infection Experiment Priyanka (Bacterial infection in Macrophages)

to install python libraries use anaconda and requirements.yml file located in the notebooks folder.

TO install type in anaconda prompt type:
>cd '/path/to/dataframes folder'
>conda env create -f requirements.yml

Notebooks include script for segmentation, data extraction and plotting. We have already performed the full analysis, so these notebooks are only to indicate 'how' the analysis was performed. For acces to the extracted Dataframes used for plotting see the Results folder. 

Segmented 3D single-cell masks for the bacteria were created and 2D single-cell masks for the macrophages. Several timepoints were included in this infection experiment = [0,12,24,48, 72] hours.

In order to redo the analysis. First, go through the notebooks in the Notebooks_Segmentation folder. Then, go through the notebooks in the Notebooks_Data_exploration folder.

In the Figures folder you can find the figures produced in these notebooks. Some of the figures were used as well for publication.

In the Data folder you find the raw experimental data used for the analysis.

In the main folder, there is also a powerpoint indicating the most important findings of this analysis.
